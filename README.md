# TourOfHeroes

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) 
version 13.3.3.

## Motivation
Angular/AngularJs is a widely used JavaScript/ TypeScript framework. This framework is 
a good way for me to also learn TypeScript, which is also an interesting take on 
implementation of OOP in JS.

## Objective
To learn about one of the most popular frontend frameworks out there and to expand my 
hard skills on that matter.
